# Elastodynamics-and-Non-Linear-FEM
This code was developed as part of the assignments for the Advanced Finite Element Methods course.

Part1 solves a Elastodynamics problem.
linear shape functions are used and it uses the Newmark scheme for time discretization.
The code also calculates Eigen values and Eigen modes.
